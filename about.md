My name is Dushyant Bansal. I lead iOS team at [GoGoVan - Uber for Logistics](http://gogovan.com.hk/en). I work remotely. Previously, I worked as an iOS and Windows Phone developer on [Ringo - Simplify international calling](http://ringo.co) and [FlockChat - Communication for fast moving teams](http://flock.co).

Apart from my day job, I have also released libaries/applications on different platforms. I started most of these projects to scratch my own itch.

* [Sidepanel](https://github.com/db42/SidePanel) - Google styled side panel for iOS written in Swift.
* [PySyncIt](https://github.com/db42/PySyncIt) - File synchronization application written in python to sync devices residing on a LAN.
* [Nemo](https://github.com/db42/Nemo) - Multi tabbed browser for iOS
* [Track your productivity - Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onnkllhiaannegcomgbogohfpeegdnnf)

I am always excited about interesting conversations. My twitter handle is [@dushyant_db](http://twitter.com/dushyant_db). Or, feel free to drop a line at *dushyant37@gmail.com*.
