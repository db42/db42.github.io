My name is Dushyant Bansal. I lead iOS team at [GoGoVan - Uber for Logistics](http://gogovan.com.hk/en). I work remotely. Previously, I worked as an iOS and Windows Phone developer on [Ringo - Simplify international calling](http://ringo.co) and [FlockChat - Communication for fast moving teams](http://flock.co).

Apart from my day job, I have also released applications on different platforms. I started most of these projects to scratch my own itch.

* [ADIMYL - A Day In MY Life](http://adimyl.com) - Making progress every day.
* [Rush reader - Speed reader for iPhone and iPad](http://rushapp.co)
* [QuickFill - Handy clipboard for iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickfill/id818680907?mt=8)
