title: Non technical learnings for a software developer
---

My professional career in software development has been over three years. Over this period I've learnt so much. Significant part of this learning fall outside of the technical knowledge circle. Yet, the importance is equal or may be more. A couple of months back, I switched to a full-time remote position. Working remotely I could clearly see and appreciate these little non-technical learnings that helps me in managing my responsibilities. 

I decided to spend some time to categorise these and put these into words. Besides sharing my learning with other people, this will also help me to proactively improve upon this.

These practices all sounds so intuitive and simple but trick lies in making these part of your muscle memory.

## 1. Communication
Communication refers to all interaction mediums with your peers, be it email, task management system, slack, a skype call or any other channel. 

### 1.1 Concise and clear
Always spend extra effort to be as clear, concise and thorough as possible. One habit worth acquiring is to proofread everything. You'll be surprised at the frequency and volume of error caught using this. Whether it's a spec discussion with the PM team or explaining something to the QA team, it always pays for the extra effort spent towards communication.

### 1.2 Share information with more people
I am pretty sure that I've read about this somewhere but can't point out the source. Almost all of the communication systems are group based. For example, you have different mailing lists for different groups of people. Here is what this rule says. Make your communication accessible to as much people as you can. If you are having some communication with a set of people, always ask if more people should have access to this. 

Infact, golden rule is unless you think this communication can act like spam to some people, more people should have access to it. Writing a mail to your buddy geeking about some high level git flows, why not send it to the whole dev team. I am pretty sure they'll be interested. Explaining some component of your codebase to your newest team member over chat, why not move this conversation to the whole dev group. Other people might have something to add or it'll freshen up their memory. I think you get the idea. More the merrier (but don't spam).

### 1.3 Document everything
This is quite similar to automation. If you find yourself explaining something more than once, document that and point to it next time. It can be anything, coding guidelines, naming conventions, build process or a test checklist for QA team.

## 2. Start using calendar
This is to make sure that people can count on you.
Not quite a long time back, I wasn't a big fan of using calendar and adding reminders. But now it has become a major component of my work flow. 

Start using a calendar - google, itunes what. Just remember to integrate it with your primary device Laptop, iPad , phone whatever. Whenever you have some future responsibility, some meeting(ouch!), a PR review or a discussion session with your buddy, just add it to your calendar and forget about it. 
Even if you don't add it to the calendar, you'll forget about it. Your mind can only keep a limited context and you wouldn't want to use it for mundane tasks such as reminders.

## 3. Be proactive in sharing information
This might be a bit hard to put into words. I haven't encountered any discussions around this before. This is about sharing information as quickly as possible. It can be as simple as sharing updates of tasks assigned to you or a potential delay in your next release. Don't wait for somebody to ask, just add a quick update about it. 

You might come across some information through a more complex route. You are working on a particular feature. You are in the zone. While testing, you encounter some warning/error in some other piece of code. You just can't afford the context switch to explore more about it. You should take whatever information you have (no need to dig more) and quickly dump it to your bug tracker with the title "potential issue in XYZ". Don't copy/paste it locally to act on it in future, just add it directly and be done with it. There can be other similar instances.
