title: More power to terminal in mac by enabling vim
---
Two steps to give yourself a massive productivity boost in your terminal.

1. Enable vim mode in your terminal
2. Enable case insensitive auto-completions in the terminal

How to do this?  
Just create a `~/.inputrc` file and fill it with:  

    set editing-mode vi
    set keymap vi-commanb
    set completion-ignore-case On

Last line enables case insensitive auto-completions.

What do you gain by enabling vim mode? Lots of things.   
Navigate through the history using `j, k` and `/` searches the history. And, enjoy all the other goodies that vim has to offer.  

One not-so-good thing is there is no good way to distinguish between `normal` and `edit` mode.
